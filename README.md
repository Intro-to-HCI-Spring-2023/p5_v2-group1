### Project Overview

We implemented our mobile application to offer Dartmouth students a more accessible and affordable transportation option to explore the Upper Valley by allowing students who need cars to connect with students who have cars. We strictly implemented the frontend functionality and used React `useState` and `useEffect` to track user changes in the local history.

### Technical Information

We developed the application using React Native. There were three core flows that we implemented from the interactive prototype

1. Rider requesting and deleting ride and viewing upcoming, pending, and completed rides
2. Driver accepting, declining, and deleting rides
3. Rider can leave review for completed rider for the driver and drive experience (set starts and text field review)
